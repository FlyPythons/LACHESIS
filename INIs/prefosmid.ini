#   Lachesis.ini - initialization file for Lachesis runs
#
#   This file controls how the Lachesis program is run.  Changing this file will change the inputs to Lachesis, which algorithms it runs, the heuristic
#   parameters it uses, and so forth.
#
#   When modifying Lachesis.ini, be careful about formatting!  Each line must be of the form "key = value", where key and value are text strings, with no
#   internal spaces.  There must be some space around the equals sign, and there should be no leading whitespace.
#   In some cases there can be multiple values, which should be separated by tabs or spaces, without commas.
#   Commented lines (such as this one) are ignored.  Do not append comments at the end of an otherwise non-commented line.  To add or remove comments en masse
#   from this file, use the scripts commentify_INI.pl and decommentify_INI.pl in INIs/.
#   You may add or remove empty lines and commented lines, but DO NOT remove any parameters, or change the order in which the parameters appear in the file.
#   Lachesis.ini is parsed in the module RunParams.cc, in the function ParseIniFile().  If this file is formatted incorrectly, this function throws an error.
#
#   Note that values for boolean keys must be either '0' or '1'.  Any other value (including e.g., "true") will fail.

#   PARAMETERS FOR THE INPUT ASSEMBLY
#

# Directory containing the input SAM/BAM files that describe Hi-C read alignments to the draft assembly.
# This directory path can be absolute, or relative to the directory in which Lachesis is run.  This should be listed before SAM_FILES.
SAM_DIR = human/to_prefosmid

# The input SAM/BAM files that describe Hi-C read alignments to the draft assembly.
# These files should exist in SAM_DIR, above, and they should already be pre-processed (e.g., to remove PCR duplicates) and sorted by read name (not by order).
# If any of these files fails to exist, Lachesis won't run.
SAM_FILES = SRR400260.REduced.paired_only.bam SRR400261.REduced.paired_only.bam SRR400262.REduced.paired_only.bam SRR400263.REduced.paired_only.bam SRR442155.REduced.paired_only.bam SRR442156.REduced.paired_only.bam SRR442157.REduced.paired_only.bam

# A file containing the number of restriction enzyme (RE) sites per contig/scaffold in the draft assembly.
# This file should contain a row for each contig in the draft assembly, and two columns: one with the contig name, and one with an integer.
# For example, you can create the first column alone by running `grep "^\>" [fasta-filename] | cut -c2-`.
# The second column will take more work.  Try running the script CountMotifsInFasta.pl.

#
#   PARAMETERS FOR THE REFERENCE GENOME
#
#   If you are assembling a genome for which a reference already exists, you can use these parameters to inform Lachesis of the reference genome sequence.
#   You must align your draft assembly to the reference genome.  Lachesis will then evaluate its performance by comparing its clustering, ordering, and
#   orienting results to the results implied by the alignments to reference.
#   If USE_REFERENCE = 0, none of these parameters are examined or used.
#

# Use a reference genome?  Options: 0 (false), 1 (true).  If 0, then SIM_BIN_SIZE, BLAST_FILE_HEAD, and REF_ASSEMBLY_NAMES_FILE are ignored.
USE_REFERENCE = 1

# If the draft assembly is just the reference genome chopped up into simulated bins, indicate the bin size here.  Otherwise set to 0.
SIM_BIN_SIZE = 0

# File head for BLAST alignments.  You must align the draft assembly to the reference genome using BLAST (UNIX command: `blastn -outfmt 7 ...`).
# The output should go into a set of one or more files called <BLAST_FILE_HEAD>.*.blast.out, where * = 1,2,3,...
# Lachesis will create a file at <OUTPUT_DIR>/cached_data/TrueMapping.assembly.txt.  Once this file exists, you no longer need the BLAST files.
# Alternatively, if SIM_BIN_SIZE > 0 (above), BLAST_FILE_HEAD is ignored because no alignments to reference are needed.
BLAST_FILE_HEAD = human/prefosmid/assembly

# 'Names files' for fastas.  These files simply list the names of the contigs in a fasta file.  They can be generated by running `grep "^\>" [fasta-filename]`.

#
#   For each of these keys, options are 0 (false), 1 (true).
